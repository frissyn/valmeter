# valmeter

**Fully-featured Discord RPC for VALORANT powered by Rainmeter and Lua.** 

[*Still a work in progress, not worth using yet*]

## Installation

1. Install the latest stable version of Rainmeter if you don't have it already. [`Download`](https://rainmeter.net).
2. Go to the latest version in [`Releases`](https://github.com/frissyn/valmeter/releases) and zownload the `.zip` file. Unzip the folder.
3. From here you can do two things:
    + **Recommended:**
        1. Launch the `.rmskin` installer
        2. Install the skin, Rainmeter will auto-build it.
    + **Alternative:**
        1. Move the `valmeter` skin folder into your `Rainmeter/Skins` folder.
        2. Configure the skin how you want to.

## Usage

Load the skin from Rainmeter's skin menu. The skin UI should appear on your desktop if everything was installed properly. `valmeter` will automatically watch your computer's open processes and start the Rich Prescense when `RiotClientServices.exe` and `VALORANT.exe` are running. If you want to turn off valmeter, just `Unload` the Skin after right-clicking it.
