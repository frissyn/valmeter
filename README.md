**Fully-featured Discord RPC for VALORANT powered by Rainmeter and Lua.**

2. Go to the latest version in [`Releases`](https://github.com/frissyn/valmeter/releases) and zownload the `.zip` file. Unzip the folder.
3. From here you can do two things:
    + **Recommended:**
        1. Launch the `.rmskin` installer
        2. Install the skin, Rainmeter will auto-build it.
    + **Alternative:**
        1. Move the `valmeter` skin folder into your `Rainmeter/Skins` folder.
        2. Configure the skin how you want to.

## Usage

**RPC:** 

Load the skin from Rainmeter's skin menu. The skin UI should appear on your desktop if everything was installed properly. `valmeter` will automatically watch your computer's open processes and start the Rich Prescense when `RiotClientServices.exe` and `VALORANT.exe` are running.

**Settings:** 

Load the `Settings/settings.ini` skin or click the cog on the `valmeter.ini` skin to open the settings menu. Here you can configure your game's location path, RPC update interval, etc.
